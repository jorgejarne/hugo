## About The Last Game

{{<rawhtml >}}

<cc style="font-size: 16px">

It is a contest that will be organized in different cities around the world and where players must solve clues and puzzles applying all kinds of skills such as <span style="color:#42DCA3">cryptography, orientation, research, logic, social engineering and programming. </span> The first player to solve the last clue will be the winner of the prize.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Players will be able to solve many of the clues from their home, however on other occasions they will need to visit some parts of the city, so it is recommended only to participate to people who are in the city where the contest is held.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Only <span style="color:#42DCA3">50 players</span> can participate in each contest and there will be a <span style="color:#42DCA3"> single winner </span> who will be the winner of a cash prize of <span style="color:#42DCA3"> 40,000 €</span> . The game does not have time and will only end when one of the players solves the last clue. At the beginning of the contest, all participants will receive instructions and an initial clue.
